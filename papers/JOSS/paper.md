# Summary

Global optimization problems are ubiquitous to engineering and the sciences. 
Many such problems are not amenable to analytical techniques and examinations 
of some potential solutions for these problems often suggest that hill-climbing 
algorithms would be unable to navigate the jagged and confusing terrain. Despite 
this, genetic programming is often applied to these problems in the hopes that 
it will be able to identify high-quality solutions. We suspect that genetic 
programming would perform no better than random search, in agreement with the 
No Free Lunch Theorems [@wolpert1997no], and we devised this software to allow 
us to perform uniform random global search, also known as pure random search, 
on these problems. The challenge lies in creating a system that enumerates all 
possible solutions, such that we are then able to randomly select from this 
space of solutions, giving each solution the same probability of being selected.

We use a dense enumeration of full binary trees [@Tychonievich:2013] 
and modify it to allow for enumeration of n-ary trees. The enumeration algorithm we 
use is flexible, modifying its enumeration depending on the arity of the 
functions that the user supplies and the number of variables that the user 
supplies. Uniform random global search is proven to converge to the ideal 
solution as the number of iterations tends to infinity [@Solis:2012], and this is 
intuitive because with infinite repetitions, the algorithm reduces to an 
exhaustive search. The software comes with three ready examples derived from the 
popular DEAP software [@fortin2012deap]. These include the artificial ant 
problem, the even parity problem, and the multiplexer problem. The software 
is the successor to our earlier work [@towfighi2019pysrurgs] but uses a 
different enumeration algorithm that is much more generalizable whereas our 
previous algorithm was only suitable for symbolic regression problems. 

In seminal work, Langdon & Poli enumerated the 
solution space using brute force and were able to determine that different types
of random search can require different amounts of computational effort to 
reach a high-quality solution [-@langdon:1998:antspace]. They found that the random search method commonly 
used to generate the initial population of genetic programming solutions performs 
much worse than does uniform random search. We found one highly cited paper 
that claimed that genetic programming outperformed random search [@Sipper:2018],
when in fact it was comparing genetic programming to a biased type of random 
search which was then put on a further unequal footing. This software has broad 
applicability in the examination of the solution space for global optimization 
problems and in the analysis of benchmark problems, as it permits brute force 
computations in addition to random search. This software will be of use to 
researchers looking to compare the performance of their algorithms with that of
pure random search on a wide variety of global optimization problems.
